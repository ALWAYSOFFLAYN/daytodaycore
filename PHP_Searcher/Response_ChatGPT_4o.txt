Here's a PHP script that searches for a given file name in the system and outputs the directory where it is located:
```
<?php
function findFile($fileName, $searchDir = '/') {
    $iterator = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(new RecursiveDirectoryIterator($searchDir, RecursiveDirectoryIterator::SKIP_DOTS));
    
    foreach ($iterator as $file) {
        if ($file->getFilename() === $fileName) {
            return dirname($file->getPathname());
        }
    }
    
    return "File not found";
}

$fileName = readline("Enter file name: ");
$directory = findFile($fileName, '/home/kali'); // Change this to the base directory you want to search in

echo "File found in: $directory\n";
?>

```
This script recursively searches for the specified file starting from the `/home/kali` directory. If found, it prints the directory where the file is located. You can change the search directory as needed. Let me know if you need modifications! ðŸš€
